Hi!  I'm Nathan Mirman, recently a graduate from the physics PhD program at Cornell University, and a member of the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) at CERN.  In my [thesis project][topmass], I employed a *Gaussian process* machine learning technique to measure the mass of the top quark using data from the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider).

I love mining large datasets for meaningful patterns and insights.  Feel free to peruse my blog for datasets, research topics, and machine learning applications that I've been thinking about recently.  Or send me a message at [nem46@cornell.edu](mailto:nem46@cornell.edu).
