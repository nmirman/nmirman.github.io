Hi!  I'm Nathan Mirman, a recent graduate from the PhD program in particle physics from Cornell University, and a member of the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) positioned on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.  In my [thesis project][topmass], I employed a *Gaussian process* machine learning technique to measure the mass of the top quark.  I love mining large datasets for meaningful patterns and insights.  Feel free to peruse my blog for public datasets and machine learning applications that I've been thinking about recently.
