Hi!  I'm Nathan Mirman, recently a graduate from the physics PhD program at Cornell University, and a member of the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) at CERN.  In my [thesis project][topmass], I employed a *Gaussian process* machine learning technique to measure the mass of the top quark using data from the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider).  I love mining large datasets for meaningful patterns and insights.  Feel free to peruse my blog for public datasets and machine learning applications that I've been thinking about recently.
