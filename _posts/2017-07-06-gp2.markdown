In [part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-07-05-gp1.markdown %}) of this post, I talked about an application for Gaussian processes in my [thesis project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06142).  Let's continue with some of the theory behind GPs.

First, I'll tell you what's going on in this plot:

These are functions randomly drawn from a prior distribution of functions.  They have a characteristic *amplitude*, and a characteristic *lengthscale* of variations.  These properties are determined entirely by the function prior.
